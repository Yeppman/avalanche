  Our Flagship product “BALL HIVE” is an app that lets aspiring football players
  create profiles, upload content like highlight reels and workout routines,
  track performances by uploading individual statistics vetted by teammates and
  coaches, and gives exclusive information about various football trials near
  them. The app also gives them the capacity to directly connect with other
  players, coaches and scouts. The app also allows users document tournament
  data by allowing participants of tournaments create competitions and upload
  data about best performances and tournament highlight reels. The platform
  extends to Football Academies, allowed to open official pages with room to
  upload data about their players and their collective activities, to attempt to
  simplify performance tracking. Scouts have exclusive pages, where they are
  provided exclusive access to periodic reports about special talents in various
  locations of interests and have the ability to reach out directly to players
  after studying their profiles to interact with them and possibly invite them
  to trials.
